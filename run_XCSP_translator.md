# Instruction to run the translator

1. The translator is a little program that reads data from multipe files *( var.txt, doms.txt, ctr.txt, cst.txt )* and create a XML file following the XCSP Schema.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
3. See results in the console <kbd>F12</kbd>.
4. You can change the parsed files  *( var.txt, doms.txt, ctr.txt, cst.txt )* by changing the `url` variable in the file called `createXml.js`.
5. Finally copy the code result as `outterHTML`.

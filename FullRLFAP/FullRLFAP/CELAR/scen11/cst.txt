Objective : If there are several solutions find that one which uses the
mimimalnumber of assigned values.
If there is no solution minimize the cost function with the following
coefficient :

             a1 = 1000
             a2 =  100
             a3 =   10
             a4 =    1
             b1 =    0
             b2 =    0
             b3 =    0
             b4 =    0

The three  directories CELAR, GRAPH and  SUBCELAR6 contain the definition of
the radio link frequency assignment problems described in (the forthcoming):

Radio Link Frequency Assignment Benchmarks. B. Cabon, S. de Givry,
L. Lobjois, T. Schiex and J.P. Warners. CONSTRAINTS journal. 1998.

The  first directory  holds  the CELAR  instances,   provided by the  Centre
d'Electronique de l'Armement (France).

The second directory  holds the GRAPH instances,  generated using  the GRAPH
generator at Delft University (the Netherlands).

The third directory holds the  SUBCELAR6 instances which have been extracted
from  the  CELAR6 instance  by  the   combinatorial  optimization group   of
ONERA/CERT (France) to prove optimality of the best solution known.
